# Style with CSS - Lab 1

## About

You will learn about how to apply styles to your HTML with CSS.

You will start with an HTML document that needs style. There are several ways to add style, and we will explore two of them here: inline style and internal style sheets.

## Instructions

**Internal style sheets: getting started with style** You will simply add a style rule to each of the style attributes you find in the elements on the page.

1. First, look for the style attributes on the HTML elements in the page. Add inline style to rules. It can by any style you want. It could be color, border, background-color, anything! See the w3Schools page on [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_css.asp)

**Creating and styling a list.** You will create a list in HTML and add style to it. You may use inline CSS or internal CSS. Look this up on w3schools!

2. Next add a list. You may choose ul or ol. Make at least 4 list items in the list.

**Internal Style sheets:** In the HEAD of the document, there is a STYLE tag containing style rules. Here, you can add style the entire page instead of just one element at a time.

3. In the style tag at the top (internal CSS), add a color property for every tag name used in your HTML document: h1, h2, p, em and others.

**More styles for more tag names**: You can add style to the semantic html tags as well. header, footer, and main might have different rules. For example, you might want the font for footer to be smaller. You migth want the header to have a certain color background.  

4. Add style rules for the header, footer and main elements yourself.

**Double checking your work**

5. At this point, be careful to watch if your code stops working! If your code stops working, STOP and FIX YOUR CODE before moving on!!! Your code should work after each step. If it stops working, you may have added a bug somewhere. Check for missing colons, semicolons, quotation marks or closing tags.

**Tables** There is a table on the page. Search for TABLE CSS on w3schools for some inspiration!

6. Go to w3schools and research how to make borders on your tables. You may use inline styles or CSS rules in the STYLE tag.

**CSS classes:** Classes are an important part of the professional use of CSS. It is a powerful way to encapulate the rules you need for a type of custom element and apply them anywhere with ease and efficiency. Look at the example class I called paragraph-1 and see what you can discover.

7. For the element with the class for .paragraph-1, add margin and padding. What do you notice about the pink background? Does it change when you add margin? Does it change when you add padding? Add a class to one of your own elements on your page. Create a rule set for that element in the style tag in the head.

**Room for creativity:** It's important to know how to get more information on your own. Go on w3schools and find something that interests you!

9. Go to w3schools and find something new you haven't used yet.

## Bonus and Extension

* BONUS: Change the content of this page  to something you like (super cars, knitting, Donkey Kong). Add one or two more pages (they may be called GALLERY and ABOUT) and style them with CSS. (You might want to move the NAV element to the top.)

* EXTENSION: Explore the concept of a CSS gradient. Create a few different gradients on your page. Try combining an alpha channel with a background image.
